# gas laws
**Reid Coyle**

## ideal gas law
- isothermal conditions
- we are running the intergal to find area under this curve which is work
- heat is added to this system to keep temperuature constant 

## adiabatic work
-indicates no heat transfer in or out of the system (so heat is stored)
- The area under this curve finds work

| Steper curve follows a more linear pathway as set up by p = nRT/V. Though it is not quite linear this is because heat is added to the system to keep Temperuature constant | seems to flatten out in the curve has a less step gradient as volume increase, this is becasue it is a perfect inslated system
